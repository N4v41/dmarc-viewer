            <h3 id="{{item_id}}">What is this tool all about?</h3>
            This tool lets you visually analyze DMARC aggregate reports. The tool differs between incoming and outgoing reports. Incoming reports you receive from foreign domains (reporter) based on e-mail messages, the reporter received, purportedly from you. Outgoing reports on the other hand you send to foreign domains based on e-mail messages that you received, purportedly by them. To analyze reports you need to use the provided parser management command and parse your reports into your database.
            <h3 id="{{item_id}}">What is on the Overview page?</h3>
            The Overview page shows general information about all incoming and outgoing reports to give you an idea about what is stored in your database. For both report types it shows the date ranges for which you have reports stored. These dates are based on the date range attribute of reports and can be faulty. Additionally it shows you the total amount of report receiver domains, reports and messages for incoming and outgoing reports. Also you can compare aligned DKIM, aligned SPF and evaluated DMARC disposition for all messages of both report types.
            <h3 id="{{item_id}}">Where can I get detailed analysis views?</h3>
            The Deep Analysis page is the heart of the tool. Currently 3 analysis types are supported. A map - showing where messages came from, a time line - showing when messages came, and a table - showing DMARC records from DMARC reports. You can fully control what data, i.e. what reports are displayed by generating analysis views in the View Management section. On top of a view, you see its title and description, a list of the applied filters and the analysis types. Btw. you can also export your views (charts as PDF, table as CSV).
            <h3 id="{{item_id}}">How can I manage my views?</h3>
            On the View Management page you can create, edit, clone, delete and sort the views for your Deep Analysis page. By dragging the arrow handles (left) you can move views up and down, which will be reflected in the Deep Analysis sidebar. By clicking "Add View", or "Edit" on a particular View you will enter the View Editor, this is where you control what data a view is based on.
            <h3 id="{{item_id}}">How exactly do I create or edit a view?</h3>
            In the View Editor, reached from the Deep Analisys or View Management page, you can define what data is seen in that view. Each view has to be given a title and a description to immediately understand what you are looking at when you check out the view in the Deep Analysis section. Furthermore you can control if the view is displayed in the Deep Analysis sidebar at all. You can also enable and disable the various view types (map, table, line chart). Next thing is to decide whether this view should be based on incoming or outgoing reports and what time range you want data to be displayed for. After you have filled out the general view info and filters you can define your filter sets. You will need at least one filter set to display any data at all in the view. Creating multiple filter sets is especially useful if you want to compare two or more data sets in the line chart, eg. DKIM passes vs. DKIM fails. The map type shows each data set separately within a view and the table type merges all records of all data sets. Next to a label and a color for the filter set, you can apply filters basically on all properties of a DMARC report.
